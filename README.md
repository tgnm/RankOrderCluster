# RankOrderCluster
Clustering algorithm for face tagging based on this Microsoft Research paper: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/jiansun/papers/cvpr11_facerankorder.pdf

This was a pet project of mine since I wanted to try and build a platform that allowed people to share photos based on the persons automatically tagged on them.

The implementation is complete and the code in itself runs but the results are not good yet.
