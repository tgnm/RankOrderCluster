# RankOrderCluster
Clustering algorithm for face tagging based on this Microsoft Research paper: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/jiansun/papers/cvpr11_facerankorder.pdf

This was a pet project of mine since I wanted to try and build a platform to allow people to share photos based on rules defined by persons automatically tagged on a photo.

The implementation is complete and the code in itself runs but the results are far from good.
